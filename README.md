# ecETFL


This code is an early release. You will need [pyTFA](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/pytfa) and [ETFL](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl) to run it. We recommend using commercial solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi to run these problems.

For further details, see [ETFL's instruction](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl/blob/master/README.rst).
