# ecETFL
This is the code for [Oftadeh, O., and Hatzimanikatis, V., "Genome-scale models of metabolism and expression predict the metabolic burden of recombinant protein expression." Metabolic Engineering 84 (2024)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymben.2024.06.005).

You will need [pyTFA](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/pytfa) and [ETFL](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl) to run it. We recommend using commercial solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi to run these problems.

For further details, see [ETFL's instruction](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl/blob/master/README.rst).

The data to reconstruct the wild-type model is adopted from [Salvy, P., Hatzimanikatis, V., "The ETFL formulation allows multi-omics integration in thermodynamics-compliant metabolism and expression models" Nat Commun 11, 30 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13818-7).
