# ecETFL

You will need [pyTFA](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/pytfa) and [ETFL](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl) to run it. We recommend using commercial solvers such as CPLEX or Gurobi to run these problems.

For further details, see [ETFL's instruction](https://github.com/EPFL-LCSB/etfl/blob/master/README.rst).

The data to reconstruct the wild-type model (info_ecoli) is adopted from [Salvy, P., Hatzimanikatis, V., "The ETFL formulation allows multi-omics integration in thermodynamics-compliant metabolism and expression models" Nat Commun 11, 30 (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-019-13818-7).
